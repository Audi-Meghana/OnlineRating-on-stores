This demo showcases my full-stack web application built using the MERN stack. The project enables users to explore stores and submit ratings while helping store owners understand customer feedback. Admin can manage users and stores, assign ownership, and view analytics. The platform supports login, secure token authorization, dynamic dashboards, and attractive UI elements such as widgets and cards.
